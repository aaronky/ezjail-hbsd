.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ezjail-admin
tool is used to manage jails inside the ezjail scope. It is not used 
to start or stop ezjails jails. Refer to ezjail(5) for more details. 
.SH ezjail-admin create
makes a copy of the ezjail template jail to the standard jail directory,
using either the name specified with the -r option or a name derived from 
the given hostname.

If the jailroot does not start with a /, it is 
interpreted relative to ezjails root dir (default: /usr/jails). If the
given jailroot lies outside ezjails root dir, a soft link is created
inside ezjails root dir pointing to the newly created jails location.

If the -x (jail exists) option is given,
.B the first step is skipped (an existing jail is used)
useful in situations where you just want to alter some of a jail properties and 
called ezjail-admin delete without the -w option before. However, sanity 
checks are being performed.

It then creates an entry in its
.I EZJAIL_PREFIX/etc/ezjail/
resource directory allowing the jail to be brought up after next reboot.

If the ezjail_mount_enable option is set, a
.I /etc/fstab.hostname
is generated, allowing the basejail to be auto-mounted when the jail starts 
up.

The newly created Jail can perform some initializiation actions, if the
-f
.I flavour
option is given, where
.I flavour
is a directory directory tree under ezjails root dir (default:
.I /usr/jails/flavours).
See section
.B FLAVOURS
below for more details.

Options for newly created jails are read from
.B ezjail.conf,
refer to ezjail.conf(5) for more information.
.SH ezjail-admin delete
removes a jail from ezjails
.I EZJAIL_PREFIX/etc/ezjail/
resource directory thus preventing 
it from being brought up on next reboot.

It then removes the
.I /etc/fstab.hostname
entry, if it exists.

If the -w (wipe) option is given, the directory pointed to by the jail 
root entry is removed as well as the soft link in ezjails root dir.
.SH ezjail-admin list
lists all jails inside ezjails scope, together with some information on 
them.
.SH ezjail-admin update
is used to create or update ezjails basejail. Depending on the parameters
given it will install a FreeBSD system from a source tree whose location
is either provided in the
.B ezjail.conf
config file or via the -s option.

If the -p or -P options are given, the base jail is given a copy of FreeBSDs
ports tree, which is in turn linked into all newly created ezjails.

If the -P option is given,
.B only the ports tree will be checked out/updated,
this can be done, while jails are running.

If the -i (install only) option is given,
.B ezjail-admin update
only performes a
.I make installworld,
otherwise
.I make world
is invoked.

.SH NOTES
.B ezjail-admin update
uses a temporary directory to install its world to, thus leaving intact
all installed libraries, if a base jail already exists.

When using the
.B ezjail-admin update
option, be careful to use the same FreeBSD source tree used to build the 
host systems world, or at least its kernel. Combining a make world in the 
host system with
.B ezjail-admin update
is considered a good idea.

When a ports tree exists in base jail, a make.conf containing reasonable
values for having ports in jails is created in the template jail.
.SH FLAVOURS
.B ezjail-admin
provides an easy way to create many Jails with similar or identical
properties. Currently it supports creating users, installing files and
installing packages.

A sample flavour config directory resides under
.I EZJAIL_PREFIX/share/examples/ezjail/default/.
Some typical Jail initialization actions are demonstrated and you are
encouraged to use it as a template for your flavours.

If a flavour is selected on Jail creation, the flavour root is being
copied to the new Jails root, mostly containing an
.I /ezjail.flavour .
If the Jail starts up for the first time it runs a setup script found
at
.I /etc/rc.d/ezjail-config.sh.

This script will create some users specified in the flavour config.
It will then chown files specified in the flavour config. (This is to allow
giving file to users that didn't exist on Jail creation time.) All
packages residing under
.I /pkg
will be installed. Finally the script
.I /ezjail.postinstall
is being sourced, if it exists.

.I ezjail-config.sh
then removes all traces, including itself.
